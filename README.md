- A new version of the Snake game is now controlled with arrow keys and features walls on all four sides, adding an extra layer of challenge for players.

- It’s no longer a solo game; a Computer Player has been added, and scores are based on the length of the snake’s remaining tail.

- The game records the positions of the snake using a LinkedList, which the Computer Player uses to calculate safe paths, avoiding collisions with walls and the Human Player.

- The game ends when a snake collides with a wall or its tail length reaches zero.
